# DRIVING LICENSE VERIFICATION
  
# INTRODUCTION:
     The finger-print based System for driving licensing verification. Biometrics is one of the most critical emerging technology. As the world becomes more volatile and potentially more vulnerable to fraudulent forces, our fate lies within our ability to secure and protect critical data and facilities. From these different available biometric features Finger Print is one of the best features which provides good mismatch ratio and reliability. Driving without license is a major issue in many countries. Survey says that the accidents happened mostly by unlicensed drivers. The new system Finger print identification is proposed.We represent the design of a prototype automatic license verification system and its implementation. It uses fingerprints to verify the identity of an individual. If the finger print stored in the controller and finger print swiped in the device matches, he/she can proceed for ignition and otherwise ignition will not work. This will reduce the accidents happened by unlicensed drivers.
